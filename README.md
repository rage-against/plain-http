Common, it's freaking 2017 already, and the lack of HTTPS support globally on the web is a sick joke at your own security expense.

Let's be rational and simply say it (out loud):

## Why Plan HTTP connections are a problem?
 - You are not safe
  - The data you send and receive online can be read by anyone between you and the website
 - Sites that does not enforce HTTPS don't care about your security
 
## How can I make the world a safer place?
 
 - If you're a Web Developer / or anyhow responsible for a website:
  - Support HTTPS and take good care of your private key
  - Enforce your users through HTTPS, no plain connection should be allowed.
 - If you're a user (everybody is):
  - Install chrome or firefox extensions that only allow you to browse on HTTPS sites.
  - Refuse to no shop or type passwords or any sensitive information on non-secure websites.
  - Publicly shame websites who does not support HTTPS.
